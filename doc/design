DESIGN GOALS:

 - Exclusive decisions/diverging strategies/mutually exclusive paths
 - Interesting synergies; promote discovery and experimentation
 - Make all information public and accessible
 - Allow creativity (no dominant strategies, difficult to optimize)

PROBLEMS TO WATCH/SOLVE:

 - If the focus is too much on buildings, what slows down an engineering heavy strategy?
   - Material and engineering costs are a bottleneck, but engineers can just build production/power facilities
   - Maybe it's just enough to provide lots of requirements and force prioritization

BUILDING SHAPES

 - Encourage visually pleasing building shapes
   - Discourage sprawl (lots of small buildings) and stacking (one large building)
     - Flat energy cost for new buildings (5?)
     - Growing energy cost as buildings grow (slow growth early, large growth for already large buildings)
   - Encourage holes
     - Bonuses for empty cells near some blocks (vary between 1, 2, 3 empty cells)
     - Some buildings are naturally "hole-like" for aesthetic purposes?
   - Encourage natural growth
     - Hopefully a side effect of adjacency bonuses and composite buildings
   - Encourage symmetry
     - Or at least don't penalize symmetry, allowing the player to build symmetrically if desired
 - A "completed" colony should naturally look nice
